# Read Only Input Metadata without Donwload

Sometimes, you may want to just access input metadata without downloading the actual files.
This can be useful for quickly checking what files are available
or for processing metadata without needing the full dataset.

## Testing Locally

There is a local example inputs file that you can use to test the functionality.
To run the example, use the following command (in current directory):

```bash
python show-input-metadata.py
```
